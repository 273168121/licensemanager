# .NET License Manager
This small project will help you to manage licensing in your .NET applications. Please note that it's still
a work in progress (inspired from Stack Overflow [Where can I store (and manage) Application license information?](http://stackoverflow.com/q/20676008/1207195)) then many things need to be completed (see issues) and code must be reviewed and simplified.

All documentation is still a TO DO, please refer to both source code and cited SO post.

Any help on this (also for documentation) is more than welcome!
